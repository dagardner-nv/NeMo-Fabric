# Check Release Deployments

Require the release tag as input. Do not infer the tag from the current branch,
Git history, or package metadata.

Run the checker from the repository root:

```bash
bash .agents/skills/check-release-deployments/scripts/check_release_deployments.sh <tag>
```

The checker converts the tag independently for Cargo, Python, and Node.js;
discovers the tracked package manifests in their respective source trees; and
reports every matching, tag-triggered GitHub Actions release workflow, except
`Request NVSkills CI`, before the package deployment table. If the `Publish Rust crates`, `Python`, or `Publish
TypeScript package` workflow concludes with `failure`, the corresponding Cargo,
Python, or Node.js registry checks are skipped and the table states why. For
Python packages, it uses PyPI's JSON Index API at
`/simple/<project>/` and verifies that the normalized version is in the
response's `versions` list. It waits at least 0.1 seconds before every request
to a registry website or GitHub API call to avoid rate limits. For Node.js
packages, it uses npm's registry API at
`https://registry.npmjs.org/<package>/<version>`. For Cargo packages, it uses
crates.io's versioned registry API at
`https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<crate>/<version>` and excludes the internal
`crates/fabric-python/Cargo.toml` binding manifest.

Interpret the table status column as follows:

- `☑` indicates the exact package version is deployed.
- `○` indicates the exact package version is not deployed.
- Any other value is the HTTP status code returned by the registry.

The workflow is read-only. Do not retry failed or undeployed packages by
publishing them unless the user separately asks to publish.
